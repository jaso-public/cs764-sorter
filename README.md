### Setup
1 CPU core, 1MB cache, 100 MB DRAM; SSD: 10GB capacity, 0.1 ms latency, 200 MB/s bandwidth;
HDD: infinity capacity, 5 ms latency, 100 MB/s bandwidth

## Definitions
#### Latency
Definition: time is takes for data to move

### Bandwidth   
Definition: capacity that a network can transmit data

### Solid State Drive (SSD)
- Store info on flash memory; retains data without power
- Accessed digitally by memory controller
- Can access info faster than HDD
- Smaller than HDD

### Hard Disk Drive (HDD)
